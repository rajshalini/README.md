#  AI-Based Career Recommendation System

This is a rule-based AI project built using **Python** and **Streamlit** that helps users find suitable career paths based on their **interests, skills, academic performance**, and **work preferences**.

##  Project Overview

The system takes the following inputs:
- Interests (e.g., Data, Design, Technology, etc.)
- Skills (e.g., Programming, Math, Communication)
- Academic scores (10th, 12th, College %)
- Preferred work style (e.g., Team-based, Creative)

Based on these inputs, it uses a set of predefined logic rules to recommend a suitable career path such as:
- Data Scientist
- Software Engineer
- UI/UX Designer
- Business Analyst
- Financial Analyst

##  Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Streamlit** (for interactive web app UI)

2. Run the app:

##  Future Scope

- Replace rule-based logic with **Machine Learning models**
- Add a **user feedback loop** to refine suggestions
- Integrate **career database APIs** for live information
